  title: Turing Machine Nightmare
  author: Sean Obach
  description: 'Based on the board game Turing Machine: https://www.turingmachine.info/


    The object of this game is to determine the 3 digit number that is generated by
    the machine. The machine will give you some tools to deduce what the 3 digit number
    is, with some limitations. The only problem is that you don''t know which letter
    is associated with what clue. Good luck.
